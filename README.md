# Netflix-Data-Analysis
In this project, I performed an exploratory data analysis on the Netflix dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The data was cleaned and pre-processed by handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues to ensure accuracy. I analyzed content distribution across different genres, release years, ratings, and countries to identify viewing and production trends. The analysis revealed key insights such as the increasing growth of Netflix original content, the dominance of TV shows after 2015, and the major contributions from countries like the United States and India. Visualizations including bar charts, heatmaps, and trend graphs were created to effectively present the findings, which can help inform content strategy and audience targeting decisions.
